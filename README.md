# Tasty Jams

## Description

Tasty Jams is a crowd sourced music rating app. Randomly pulling from the Billboard Top 100 playlist on spotify, the app produces a song for the user to rate on a scale from one to five. One being 'foul' and five being 'tasty'. The user can rate as many of the Top 100 as they choose, and the playlist updates in real time with the charts.

## Development

This application was constructed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For the CSS, we utilized the Materialize library for advanced styling. Two third part APIs are employed to present data on the page: spotify and Wikipedia. A JavaScript function randomly pulls one song from the Billboard Top 100 playlist, and presents it on the page for the user to listen to and rate. Likewise, the Wikipedia API takes the randomly selected song and incorporates a link into the More Info button for the user to click if they desire.

## Credits

The Tasty Jams development team consists of Erin Hamrick, Paul Jang, Paul Allen, and Ethan Trudell. Much like the philosophy of the app itself, the development team took on a communal approach in the development of this application. While working together, separate branches were created to utilize the Git FLow methodology in order to fully experience the team approach to web development.
